# CSE-Recipes
Recipes for spawn eggs in the Craftable Spawn Eggs (Fabric) mod for Minecraft

This is mainly for those who do not want to or do not have mods that can help with recipes such as Roughly Enough Items. It is also a temporary solution till I can make a better way of implementing the recipes

If there are any items in the recipe photos you are unsure about, you can view the recipes in a json file

Main crafting material is the Base Spawn Egg and is used for most of the spawn egg recipes
Remember that all recipes with potions and tipped arrows can be made with any potion, tipped arrow, etc.
